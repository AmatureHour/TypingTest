The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama film written and
directed by Wes Anderson. Ralph Fiennes leads a seventeen-actor
ensemble cast as Monsieur Gustave H., renowned concierge of a
fictional European mountainside resort. When Gustave is framed
for the murder of a wealthy dowager (Tilda Swinton), he embarks
on a quest for fortune and a priceless Renaissance painting with
his recently befriended lobby boy (Tony Revolori). Thematic analysis
focuses on the function of color as a storytelling device and
the film's exploration of fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and
loyalty. The Grand Budapest Hotel was based on Anderson and longtime
collaborator Hugo Guinness's vision of a fragmented tale of a
character inspired by a mutual friend. Filming took place in Germany
over ten weeks, in the regions around Berlin and Saxony. After
premiering at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014,
the film grossed more than $172 million at the global box office.
The Grand Budapest Hotel was released to highly positive reviews,
and won four Academy Awards for music and technical achievement.
