The République class consisted of a pair of pre-dreadnought battleships—République
and Patrie (pictured)—built for the French Navy in the early 1900s.
They were a significant improvement over previous French battleships,
with the same four 305 mm (12 in) guns and eighteen 164 mm (6.5 in)
guns, but with most of the 164 mm guns mounted in gun turrets
rather than in casemates. They also had more effective armored
protection. Both ships entered service in January 1907, shortly
after the British HMS Dreadnought made all existing battleships
obsolescent. During World War I, both ships operated in the Mediterranean.
Patrie supported the Gallipoli campaign from May 1915 and République
joined her in January 1916. Both ships then became involved in
Greece, where they assisted a coup against the neutral but pro-German
government that ultimately led to Greece's entry into the war
on the side of the Allies. Neither ship saw any further action.
République was decommissioned in 1921, and Patrie not until 1937.
