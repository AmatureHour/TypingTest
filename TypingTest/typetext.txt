The northern voalavo (Voalavo gymnocaudus) is a rodent found in
the highlands of northern Madagascar first discovered in 1994.
It is the type species of the genus Voalavo, and its closest relative
is the eastern voalavo of the Central Highlands. It is found at
1,250 to 1,950 m (4,100 to 6,400 ft) above sea level in montane
wet and dry forests in the northern massifs. It is nocturnal,
solitary and terrestrial, but it can climb and probably eats plant
matter. Despite having a small range, the species is classified
as being of least concern because it lacks obvious threats and
lives mainly in protected areas. It is a small, mouse-like rodent
with soft, gray fur, only slightly darker above than below. The
ears are short and rounded. The long tail appears mostly naked
and lacks a distinct tuft. The skull is delicate, with a long,
narrow front part, narrow space between the eyes, and no development
of ridges on the braincase. The molars are relatively high-crowned.
It has a body mass of 17 to 25.5 g (0.60 to 0.90 oz). (This article
