# TypingPractice
This is a simple typing practice program that takes the article of the day
from Wikipedia as the typing text. It checks accuracy in real time and will 
post your data to the database. Eventually it will have login credentials
and use machine learning to figure out what you need help with and auto 
generate words that you need to practice.
